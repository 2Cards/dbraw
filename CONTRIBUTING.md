# Contribution Guide ⚙️

Welcome to DBRaw! We follow a strict engineering protocol to maintain technical excellence.

## 🛠 Workflow

1.  **Issues First:** Every change or bug must start with a GitHub Issue.
2.  **Branching:** Create a descriptive branch from `main`. Use `feat/`, `fix/`, or `chore/` prefixes.
3.  **Pull Requests:** Direct pushes to `main` are restricted. All changes must go through a Pull Request.
4.  **Language:** All technical communication (Issue titles, PR descriptions, comments, commit messages) must be in **English**.

## 📝 Creating an Issue

-   Use a clear, objective title.
-   Provide a "Context" section explaining why this is needed.
-   Provide "Steps to Reproduce" for bugs.
-   Assign the relevant labels.

## 🚀 Creating a Pull Request

-   Link the PR to an existing Issue (e.g., `Closes #123`).
-   Include a concise description of the implementation.
-   Ensure the project builds locally (`npm run build`) before submitting.

## ⚖️ Standards

-   **Code Quality:** Keep it clean, DRY, and modular.
-   **Security:** Never commit secrets. Respect user privacy (LocalStorage only).
-   **Style:** Maintain the "Sketch" aesthetic where applicable.
